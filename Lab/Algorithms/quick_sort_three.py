    We gonna divide the array into three parts: Those who are less than the pivot, those who are equal to the pivot and those who are greater than the pivot
    Keep a pointer to the start and the end of the array, we iterate on the array with i.
    Each time i is less than the pivot, we swap i with the start pointer and increment both pointers
    Each time i is greater than the pivot, we swap i with the end pointer and decrement the end pointer
    If i is equal to the pivot, we just increment i
    Here we do an example walkthrough:
    [3, 5, 2, 3, 8, 1, 3, 7, 3, 6, 2], pivot = 3, left = 0, right = 10
    i = 1. arr[1] > pivot, swap arr[1] with arr[right], right = 9, i = 1 [3, 2, 2, 3, 8, 1, 3, 7, 3, 6, 5]
    i = 1, arr[1] < pivot, swap arr[1] with arr[left], left = 1, i = 2 [2, 3, 2, 3, 8, 1, 3, 7, 3, 6, 5]
    ... Continue this process until i > right
    [2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 5]
    Now we recursively sort the left and right sections [2, 2, 1] and [6, 7, 8, 5]
    Average Case:O(n log n). Worst Case: O(nÂ²). 3-way is useful when there are many duplicate keys
